Versioning: [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

For releases before v1.3.35, see [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/VladoIvankovic/Codeep/releases).

## [1.3.37] — 2026-04-29

### Changed
- Maintenance release. Republished with the same code as v1.3.36 to align the
  npm version, GitHub binaries, and Homebrew formula across all distribution
  channels. If you're on v1.3.36, no need to upgrade.

## [1.3.36] — 2026-04-28

### Added
- **`session/list_providers` ACP method** — returns the canonical provider
  catalog (`id`, `name`, `groupLabel`, `hint`, `requiresKey`, `subscribeUrl`)
  so ACP clients no longer need to hard-code provider lists. Prerequisite for
  Codeep VS Code extension v0.1.23+, which fetches the catalog dynamically.
- **`groupLabel` and `hint` fields** in `ProviderConfig` (`src/config/providers.ts`)
  for richer client-side rendering of the provider picker.

## [1.3.35] — 2026-04-28

### Added
- **Diff previews on permission prompts** — manual-mode `session/request_permission`
  payloads now include the actual change (`old_string` / `new_string` for
  `edit_file`, full content for `write_file`, command + cwd for `execute_command`).
  Truncated at ~4 KB per field, 200 lines per file. Other ACP clients see the
  extra fields as harmless additional keys.
- **Reasoning stream support** — `agent_thought_chunk` notifications flow
  through to clients that subscribe to them, so models with extended thinking
  (Claude, GPT-5 reasoning, DeepSeek R1, etc.) can surface their reasoning UI.

### Changed
- Input formatting tweaks for clearer user-side verification.
